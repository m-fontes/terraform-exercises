First Steps Using Terraform

This repo contains files used during "first step" exercises while learning Terraform.

Installation ==> https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

Getting Started ==> https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/build

Note:
- When running 'example/terraform.sh', make sure the env. vars. 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
  and 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' are defined in your system. TF will read them to authenticate
  to AWS. The script will abort if they're undefined.
